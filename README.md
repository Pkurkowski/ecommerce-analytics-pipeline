eCommerce Analytics Pipeline
This repository demonstrates an end-to-end data collection pipeline for an eCommerce website. The pipeline pulls user behavior and event data from a Snowflake data warehouse, processes the data to extract key metrics (such as user journeys and conversion funnels), and passes the processed data to analytics platforms such as Heap or Amplitude for real-time tracking and analysis.

Project Overview
This project showcases how eCommerce platforms can leverage user behavior and event data to optimize their customer journeys and conversion rates. The pipeline includes:

Data Extraction: Pulling eCommerce event data from Snowflake.
Data Processing: Cleaning and structuring event data to calculate key business metrics.
Analytics Integration: Sending processed data to analytics tools like Heap or Amplitude for tracking.
The pipeline tracks typical eCommerce events, such as:

Page Views (e.g., product pages, category pages).
Product Views (specific product interactions).
Add to Cart actions.
Purchases (completed transactions).
Session and engagement metrics (e.g., time spent, bounce rates).

Requirements
To run this project, you'll need the following:

Python 3.x
Python libraries:
requests (for API calls)
pandas (for data processing)
snowflake-connector-python (for Snowflake integration)
psycopg2 (for database connections, if necessary)
Install the required Python packages with:

bash
Copy code
pip install requests pandas snowflake-connector-python
How to Run
1. Snowflake Data Extraction
The snowflake_data_extractor.py script connects to Snowflake and pulls event data from the last 7 days.

bash
Copy code
python snowflake_data_extractor.py
2. Data Processing
Once the raw data is extracted, the event_processor.py script processes it to calculate key eCommerce metrics like conversion funnels and engagement rates.

bash
Copy code
python event_processor.py
3. Sending Data to Heap or Amplitude
Finally, the heap_amplitude_integration.py script sends the processed event data to Heap or Amplitude via their respective APIs.

bash
Copy code
python heap_amplitude_integration.py
4. Sample Data
If you want to test the pipeline without connecting to Snowflake, you can use the provided sample_event_data.csv.

Snowflake Table Structure
Below is the structure of the Snowflake table used to store eCommerce event data:

sql
Copy code
CREATE TABLE ecommerce_events (
    event_id STRING,
    user_id STRING,
    event_type STRING,
    event_timestamp TIMESTAMP,
    product_id STRING,
    product_category STRING,
    session_id STRING,
    page_url STRING,
    referrer_url STRING,
    cart_value FLOAT
);
Key Event Types:
page_view: When a user views a page.
product_view: When a user views a product.
add_to_cart: When a user adds an item to their cart.
purchase: When a user completes a purchase.
checkout_start: When a user begins the checkout process.
API Integration
Heap Integration
The heap_amplitude_integration.py script uses Heap's API to track events. You will need your Heap App ID to send events.

Amplitude Integration
The same script can also send data to Amplitude by replacing the Heap API URL with Amplitude’s API endpoint. You'll need your Amplitude API key.

Future Improvements
Add support for other analytics platforms (e.g., Google Analytics, Mixpanel).
Automate the entire pipeline using scheduled jobs (e.g., AWS Lambda or Airflow).
Expand the event types to include more detailed user interactions, such as specific product category views or search behavior.
